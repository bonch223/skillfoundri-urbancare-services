**📝 Notes:**
- This checklist is designed to be modular - each section can be tackled independently
- Priority levels can be adjusted based on business needs and user feedback
- Regular progress reviews should be conducted every 2 weeks
- User testing should be integrated throughout each phase
- Each completed feature should include documentation and testing

**🚀 Recommended Starting Point:** Begin with Phase 2C (Complete UI/UX System) to create all dashboard interfaces and user experience components with mock data BEFORE proceeding to database integration. This approach allows for faster user testing, better UX iteration, and ensures the complete frontend system is ready before backend work.
